# Local Development
This repository contains 2 basic applications: `frontend` & `api`.
It is easy to manage, and you can easily add new local application(s).

## Basic structure
Application is based on [blueprints](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/blueprints/).

New extension requires:
 - new Python Package in ![ethtx_ce](ethtx_ce/app/app) subdirectory.
- `create_app` function (created in new package in `init` file) which returns `Flask` object by calling ![app factory](ethtx_ce/app/app/factory.py) file.
- calling a function above in a `wsgi.py` file with assigned url prefix.

These simple steps allow you to add new extension and integrate with entire application.
